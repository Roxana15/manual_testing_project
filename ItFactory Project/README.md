# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Applications under test: PHPTRAVELS - Travel Portal Application for UI testing and Airport Gap for API testing.

Due to the fact that I did not have access to the original documentation, I created my own UI documentation.

Created UI documentation: [PHPTRAVELS UI Documentation](https://github.com/Roxana15/manual_testing_project/blob/main/ItFactory%20Project/PHPTRAVELS%20UI%20Documentation.pdf) 

API Documentation: https://airportgap.dev-tester.com/docs

The final project will be split into 2 sections:[Testing section](https://github.com/Roxana15/manual_testing_project/blob/main/ItFactory%20Project/README.md#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](#sql-section).

Tools used: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench.

# Functional Specifications

The below Epic was created in JIRA and describes the functional specifications of the Hotels module, for which the final project is performed upon.
